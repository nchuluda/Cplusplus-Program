- Summary -

This code allows for the user to create records for animals in captivity at The Zoo. The records are stored as a .txt file. This code can load these records to memory from the .txt file and also overwrite any changes to the records back to the .txt file. Users can load from the .txt file, add a record, delete a record, print the records currently loaded to memory and write the records back to the .txt file. A menu is included for the user to interface with these options. Basic error handling is included in the code so that the data submitted by the user conforms to formatting requirements in the .txt file.

- What did I do particularly well -

I'm proud of my work on this project. It includes an Animal class and two layers of subclasses. Structuring these properly took me time, but now I'm more familiar with how to do this in the future with less trial and error. I also felt more at ease using different styles of loops to accomplish my goal for each function. It felt more natural choosing which style of loop would best fit the need at hand.
