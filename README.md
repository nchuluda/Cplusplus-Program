- Summary 

This code allows for the user to create records for animals in captivity at The Zoo. The records are stored as a .txt file. This code can load these records to memory from the .txt file and also overwrite any changes to the records back to the .txt file. Users can load from the .txt file, add a record, delete a record, print the records currently loaded to memory and write the records back to the .txt file. A menu is included for the user to interface with these options. Basic error handling is included in the code so that the data submitted by the user conforms to formatting requirements in the .txt file.

- What did I do particularly well?

I'm proud of my work on this project. It includes an Animal class and two layers of subclasses. Structuring these properly took me time, but now I'm more familiar with how to do this in the future with less trial and error. I also felt more at ease using different styles of loops to accomplish my goal for each function. It felt more natural choosing which style of loop would best fit the need at hand. 

- Where could I enhance my code?

I could further develop the error handling of this code. For example, I could check that quantities are entered as numeric characters and not written words. A loop could check each character of the string and confirm that alphabetical characters were not found in order to accept the user input.

- Did I find this challenging?

Yes, I did. This was my first real project that integrated Java and C++. Besides this, I was overwhelmed by the amount of work requested of me. It was very difficult to decide where to begin and not feel discouraged. I started with the menu, as that seemed like the simplest feature of the code. It also allowed me to easily test each function of my code as I developed it. By approaching the project function by function, my confidence increased, and I was able to complete this challenging assignment! I had to do research for almost all of the functions as I was developing them. I used our ZyBooks text material, and supplemented this with searches for the topic at hand. Usually I was able to find relevant examples of code that I could learn from and adapt to my specific needs. Sometimes it took trial and error to fine tune things like formatting the outputted text that I was saving to the .txt file. 

- What skills from this project will be particularly transferrable to other projects?

Quite a bit of this project will be transferrable to other projects. Classes are fundamental to programming in C++ and Java. Using the various styles of loops are also foundations that are used again and again. Understanding how differnet programming languages can be integrated will surely come in handy as I continue to learn and develop code.

- How did I make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?

The code adheres to formatting guidelines specified by my university and professor. Whitespace is used to enhance readability. Comments explain each few lines of code. The code could be adapted as needed because of the organization and consistency of the formatting.
